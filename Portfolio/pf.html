                    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a fundamental web development language used to structure content on web pages. Intermediate-level proficiency involves creating structured documents with headings, paragraphs, and lists. It also includes embedding multimedia elements like images and videos, as well as understanding and utilizing links and forms for user interaction. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used to enhance the visual presentation of HTML elements, and a basic understanding of HTML5 features like semantic tags and responsive design is typically acquired at this level.</p>
